   A:

After returning your application, you will be interviewed. Interviews usually
aren't scheduled but are done immediately upon you handing your application to
the Evals Director or, if the Evals Director isn't available then, later when
they are available and know you are on floor. After your interview, you will be
brought up for vote at the weekly Evaluations meeting, it is very helpful,
though not required, to attend. Also, at the vote, if someone doesn't know who
you are they will vote against you. Therefore, the fastest and easiest way to
become a member is to be around a lot and meet everyone!
